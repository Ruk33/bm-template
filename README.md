## Developed with create react app
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Add routes
Use `node scripts/route/index.js` (will display help and how to use it)

## Add components
Use `node scripts/component/index.js` (will display help and how to use it)

## Start application for developing

## Build application for prod

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
